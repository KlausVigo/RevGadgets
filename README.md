# RevGadgets 

This repository contains all files associated with the RevGadgets R package. To start adding functionality to this package, fork this repository. We recommend that you use RStudio for package development. If you don't already have RStudio, you can download the latest version [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

Once you have RStudio installed, you can link your forked GitHub repository with RStudio. To do this, open RStudio and select File > New Project. Select Version Control and then Git. Paste in the URL to your forked repository and fill out the other required fields. This will automatically clone the repository to the directory you indicated while setting up the project.
