# RevGadgets 
### GitHub and RStudio 
This repository contains all files associated with the RevGadgets R package. To start adding functionality to this package, please work with the development branch. We recommend that you use RStudio for package development. If you don't already have RStudio, you can download the latest version [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

Once you have RStudio installed, you can link your forked GitHub repository with RStudio. To do this, open RStudio and select File > New Project. Select Version Control and then Git. Paste in the URL to your forked repository and fill out the other required fields. This will automatically clone the repository to the directory you indicated while setting up the project. 

### RStudio for package development
Once this has been set up, you'll see 4 sections in the RStudio application. Within these four sections, two can be used for viewing and editing scripts and to display the traditional R console. The other two sections can be used for a variety of purposes, including viewing plots, help files, the contents of your current directory, a list of all objects current stored in the R Session, package building tools, and an option to interact with GitHub. We recommend that you use these RStudio options to commit and push changes to the package to GitHub. 

To start developing, create files for your functions as per the developer's guide, which can be found in RevGadgets > developers_guide > developers_guide.Rmd. You can test out the package by building it, either through the Build window in RStudio or through shift-command-B (on a Mac). You can check your test files either through the RStudio Build window options or through shift-command-T (on a Mac). 

Happy developing! Feel free to contact Carrie Tribble (ctribble09@gmail.com) with any questions.
